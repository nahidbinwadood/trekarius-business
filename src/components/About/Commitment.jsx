            We are committed to making a positive impact on the planet and we
            contribute 2% of our profits towards poverty and supporting
            countries in need of assistance. This initiative was born out of our
            extensive travels across the globe and interactions with various
            individuals. Our goal is to repay the kindness and hospitality shown
            to us by less privileged countries, ensuring that they benefit from
            our contributions! We utilize environmentally friendly recycled
            materials in all of our products to support and enhance the safety
            of the environment.
